## Transcript

17:04:16 So let's see are you recording Yes, we are recording aha!
17:04:30 Welcome. Everyone can't believe it's library where did the time go already.
17:04:40 Okay, So i'm going to go straight to this because there's lots of fun stuff that we have planned for today, and I'm not even sure if an hour is enough time.
17:04:55 Okay, So today, what we're going to talk about is the information to architecture of user experience, because how else are we going to understand things that we don't even know what learning about the industry is like what kind of jobs are out there And then how do you start applying for
17:05:20 them. I'm sure you have lots and lots of questions because it all makes total sense.
17:05:25 So i'm going to like put this out there and I don't know if it makes sense, or if i'm just going off from my own assumptions of what i've seen but job titles are really confusing you see things like I don't
17:05:40 know someone out there just started making lots of like fun design titles And so there's this website there like just generate some ad hoc. So you have things like this design supporter like diverse designer of theorist design
17:05:57 technologists. Okay, that's cool what does that mean I don't know designer for product uniform.
17:06:05 I guess that's what you do trying to make everything look uniform. All right.
17:06:08 Okay, consultant for customer experience, science and concepting no idea what that means.
17:06:15 But it sounds really legit doesn't It this next one was my favorite reclusive hero of ethics delivery.
17:06:27 You get ties but a little bit more time than necessary.
17:06:32 Looking at all of these titles there's more fun than the next one.
17:06:38 But eventually it what what this is showing is that job tires are confusing as hell, and people can make up whatever tiles they want, because it just shows up whatever they want it to be. It's also showing that a lot of the the job titles that We see out
17:07:04 there change depending on like where you're at so what job titles one job, one ux designer works at what Sorry What one ux designer does at one company can be totally different at a different company and a lot of people would just use these job
17:07:26 titles of the seniority and levels as a way to designate different pay ranges.
17:07:34 And so what I shed you today will actually get a chance to look really deeply at.
17:07:40 What do you buy titles and experience in and i'm sure like?
17:07:44 Are you sure you wanna We could, take a look at like whether or not it makes sense to apply for a junior position, when, whether they're really looking for mid- or something else?
17:07:55 Right. What are they really looking for? and So i'm gonna put this link in the chat?
17:07:59 We're going to fun into a fun little exercise here that's what we do, as I ace is we make everyone do workshops.
17:08:14 So when you get a chance to go in there i'm going to stop sharing this screen and you're a different one which is sharing this one.
17:08:24 Okay, all right. So how many people to be happy or today?
17:08:29 So yeah, pen people minus grace we're gonna split all of you up into Let's see 3 rows.
17:08:44 How do I do this? Pick out rooms, and you all can choose whichever room that you want to get into right.
17:09:02 So we have well before you go in there. On the screen. there are 4 empty frames on here, and so, once you choose a frame, you can go there as your group, and then what your assignment is is to take all the cards that
17:09:35 are in the side of one frame and put it into the groups here.
17:09:47 So you have 5 different columns here and as a group you can talk and discuss like, and and put these into different places. Right?
17:09:52 So i'm and then at the end of this what we're going to do is
17:09:58 You could share your findings, and some of the discussions that you have because that's the point of their exercise is to actually talk about stuff.
17:10:04 Now the question is, can I count correctly? Okay, All right.
17:10:11 Any questions before I put you all into groups. Yeah, just just if I may just clarify for myself.
17:10:24 So these are These are like general groups, or general parts of like the design process that we are putting like actual, you know, roles that we may find as or titles of a job that we may find into these little fishlands and this these are not
17:10:42 specifically like the product, like the lifecycle of anything.
17:10:52 These are more like these are in areas of ux that people may particularly work in right.
17:10:58 So what i'm asking is like you know take all these job titles, and then just dump them into where you feel like is most relevant.
17:11:04 Okay, question. Sorry further clarification. So most relevant means we have to put them into one call. them we can't copy it.
17:11:18 I feel like that's gonna be a the aha Gotcha. Then if you want to duplicate them, you can duplicate them, but make them a different color. so I know which ones that duplicate right But ideally is if you can put them.
17:11:32 In one. If you don't then that's the Aha, yeah, thank you. We'll have 5 min on the clock, and then, if you feel that none of these if you need more time. just let me know I have my discord open So if you have anything that you want to like you know message. me just put it.
17:11:52 There. i'll be marching both. Okay, any other questions Okay, opening all the rooms you can choose, whichever room you want to go into.
17:12:05 They're all the same. Well, if you all go into the same room, you're like Oh, who's going with trim now, like dirty dude, who do I want to be with I don't know should I stop sharing I
17:12:22 should stop hearing Mentor is just stay out, or what if you want to go summer, you can go somewhere.
17:12:31 Oh, Natasha, spying on us you're muted Natasha. Sorry I have no idea what Oh, on the bottom of your zoom there is 4 squares that says breakout rooms click on that Yeah, Choose frame 5 or
17:12:56 6, and there's a link in the chat to the mural board.
17:13:00 I don't mind Sorry, do I just click that because i've never had to get into a room.
17:13:10 I just clicked the room. Yeah, there should be a blue button that says, Join.
17:14:09 I'll just stay here and see who else is coming in What's that music, you Grace?
17:19:09 You're muted. Well, that music was marrow Oh, just like did I?
17:19:22 Did I turn on spot a file is everyone else hearing this I don't. How does everybody else know my favorite song?
17:19:36 Next time we could do like I don't know they have up Temple Funk. smooth groove, cause met cosmic vibe.
17:19:44 We could try that next time. But okay, So how was that?
17:19:53 Not painful. No, it's fun yeah yeah I definitely sorry go ahead.
17:20:07 I didn't understand how strategy is different from like research like Where do these do these Not overlap like? I guess I need more clarification on what strategy means?
17:20:22 Yeah, I didn't understand that one any other like kind of views or questions that people had.
17:20:36 I saw John write a giant warning message to not peek at others people's boards, which I didn't consider until I saw that.
17:20:47 And then we started looking at other people's boards throwing that out there I would not touch. I was like you might have been looking at our board if you needed that message. if you if you zoom out big enough you'll see that everyone really
17:21:04 did had a different idea, I mean, just based on a number of stickies in each section.
17:21:10 You could see people put things in different places some people like really, you know, and not really a no, but had lots of questions around like if something had the word designer.
17:21:26 Then it definitely stated in a design column. it looked like what were some of the conversations that you all had in, as you were doing this together.
17:21:35 So since you mentioned the design thing, it came to be like just to catch all like, if it had designed. and it okay follow it there. if we don't really understand what it is.
17:21:49 But then, when we came back together and kind of looked at specific ones, I think the one about voice designer which I had never heard of but Jill did.
17:21:59 She said there was some information on track in her program about that, so we placed it elsewhere, just based off of her knowledge.
17:22:05 But overall I was pretty confused I think there are definitely like terms that if you haven't worked in like the ux or tech space, you'd have definitely have to do a lot of guessing yeah one of my I guess justin already.
17:22:26 Answered a couple of questions. I think you popped in our room.
17:22:32 But the difference between an experience designer, and user experience designer and like some of these other terms, it seems are just sort of like evolutions of like the same role, you know it's a sort of a like so you know
17:22:43 it's literally the same thing, but it's just kind of a evolved to be called a different thing.
17:23:05 Excuse me. I coughed to death. Yeah.
17:23:14 No, no. this definitely has been a very interesting thing, Because when I did this exercise with a different group of people, people always had questions like, What is strategy?
17:23:29 Yeah, what is research? What does even condense strategy or like what is a different type of area?
17:23:37 So it definitely has changed over the years in terms of like where people put things.
17:23:46 Think, you see? Do you need water? grace I was drinking water?
17:24:00 Okay, that's what did it take your time yeah anyone Maybe maybe anyone from one of their groups want to share like one of the columns sort of go through that. I think that will springboard?
17:24:21 Some conversations as well and I didn't get the capture was it Sean who was just speaking in terms of I then capture the note about overlap of design?
17:24:25 And what other carrier? Oh, just that! I mean some of these.
17:24:33 Some of these tickets are the are the same role or the same title, but maybe you know there's there's a few years gap in in them.
17:24:48 Right. we also have the full transcript. So if you wanted to look back into what shy would say, or the difference between experience designer user experience. Designer: Yeah.
17:25:02 Definitely you can be a day, an evolution of titles.
17:25:06 But at the same time, though I'm going to take over screen sharing John, it also shows that, especially what we're trying to get at is that Joppy's are confusing because they all change and there's no standardization in terms of
17:25:33 what the industry agrees. it is supposed to be a certain job right. There's no overarching certifying body of authority in the ux world. who's going to go through and standardize all these job titles and set
17:25:51 basic knowledge requirements on what only to know, to be like what those particular job titles are.
17:26:01 So it is quite interesting like how how crazy and I guess while like while Wild West, this the these titles are, and they were sitting years.
17:26:18 So yeah, even though there's no overarching body of authority that's out there is a nut. This is what a ux designer is. People can only do that for a specific company so like within Google or within know kaiser or within
17:26:31 a certain system are they gonna only say like this is how it should be at this company, and that's a standard for across the department, or whatever, and that's fine. So it's it's even harder for people to even agree
17:26:47 on what these things are across a an industry right? There is no like ux authority that can get everyone to agree on.
17:26:55 So how can we even try to standardize this across the world So what i'm saying is, don't waste your time trying to figure out what that perfect ux job title is or that you want to have Instead, you should spend the time trying to understand what your
17:27:09 core skills are where your interests lie and what kind of a ux are that they are trying to hire at the same time.
17:27:19 It's also important to note that job Titles Still, matter I guess I could talk about that later.
17:27:27 Jot titles still matter, because you can take a look at these different roles, and you can see a different mapping of what these eggs are so like. If we go deeper into like product designer then here's kind of
17:27:44 like where my arbitrary mapping of what that could be is like. Yeah, a product designer should definitely be an expert or know more about design than about content strategy or about research. or A researcher might be a really good at research, but not So much around design or have some
17:28:03 more be able to have some input into what the strategy is for a company overall.
17:28:08 Maybe right. And this is all arbitrary this is just one person's idea of what this is, and then kind of strategy would have maybe less on research, but more on other things.
17:28:20 And this changes from person. The person. what you bring to the table is very different.
17:28:27 So so just trying to get everyone to agree. that it's a mistake to assume that there are standard agreements based on roles of job titles.
17:28:41 So. so don't try and don't try to understand it because you can see all the the drama on linkedin, and people are complaining about like levels and titles and seniority. and what are people looking for is like Well, if no
17:28:52 one's gonna be around to standardize it it's a it's a very mixed messy chaos that there is.
17:29:01 You can complain about it but once. but who's going to actually step in there and fix it eventually.
17:29:09 Someone, will if they're annoyed enough of it but that's a really big undertaking to do.
17:29:17 However, Jap titles still matter. because it's one way that companies try to set your page right.
17:29:30 How much you get paid it also still matters specifically for women people of color and people from marginalized groups, especially people who are who are in tech who aren't white male and able-bodied I think people who are any of those groups do We have to do more work to prove that we're qualified to do the jobs that we're
17:29:55 applying, maybe not just in taxes just in general. But anyway, these are different ways. Debt titles are different ways that companies use to set those expectations in terms of how we get paid.
17:30:12 And how what what your seniority is, and your 10 year at a company or across companies.
17:30:20 So you Have a lot you've seen a lot of different yes, makeups of a designer.
17:30:31 So maybe you've seen this before. but you can be a T-shaped designer. So that means you have a breath of a lot of different skills.
17:30:41 So you know a lot of most things. and but then you have certain skills that you're particularly good at or that you're focused in right So sometimes you can say, Oh, yeah, that's a designer or that's a
17:30:52 researcher, because that you you focus on a certain core set of skills.
17:30:57 You can also have people who are just one area. so like motions designers might have only in this area where they do one work.
17:31:09 And this works particularly well when you work in organizations that are large enough to have people who specialize in certain areas where you don't have to know a lot of every other parts.
17:31:20 Right. You don't really have to like work across companies and so The bad thing about this is that you you would have to
17:31:32 You would have to work with other people to get things out so there's sometimes like bottleneck.
17:31:42 Happen Then you also have areas there where you could be a you know a pie shaped designer where you can have don't 2 couple areas where you're really good at But these are just some shapes. I think if you do a search for jared spool and the broken comb
17:32:03 designer. That means you can have multiple areas that you're good at. and I think those are This is more and more interesting, because then you you have lots of different capacities to learn all over the place right you can have death.
17:32:21 At different areas. And in these things, as these different areas, you grow over time, right?
17:32:27 Because this informs that it implies that the individuals can develop more skills, more knowledge and more experience over time that you don't just work in a silo area, and that's all you do so when you're looking and working on a team ideally, you work with a good number of different people and they have different skill sets that
17:32:50 they bring to the table. So, going back to that spider diagram of all different things.
17:32:56 So that's one thing and so another thing that we would like to do as we talk about the different skills that people can.
17:33:08 Yeah, I guess certain school level of you have this thing where you have like 4 different stages of competence, so like you can go from not knowing what you don't know what you don't know is what that means you don't know what you don't
17:33:26 know it could also be you're not good let's see you you know that you're not good at certain things.
17:33:37 That's the cautious incompetence conscious competence means that you do know what you're good at, and so like you can be kind of like, Oh, you know exactly what skills that you're working on and that's good
17:33:54 but at a certain point you know once you've mastered a lot of skills, you can be good at a lot of things, and you don't really have to think about it.
17:34:07 Becomes So as you're working from one stage to the next you're building on a lot of these things.
17:34:17 So. yeah from not knowing what you don't know you're building literacy, you're learning your terms you're getting used to what the processes are, as you're learning about how things work you're getting to know how to use certain
17:34:29 language, and then at another point is like as you learn to do it, you you get to practice, and that builds your fluency in those areas so that you're able to speak coherently with others.
17:35:06 On your team, and communicate what's going on and so you really like try to build it, and you're leveling up in that way.
17:35:14 And once you've actually built your fluency and and a lot of this has to do with there's different ways that you can look at levels.
17:35:18 It could be the combination of your skills, how much you own a product or project that you're working on, and how much collaboration you have on a project.
17:35:28 And, of course, how much impact do you have in an organization, and how much of a managing role that you have in terms of working with people across teams?
17:35:48 And you know people reporting to you over time so like these are different things.
17:35:54 That kind of like tall goes into the names and the job titles that are out there that you can use to understand that. And i'm gonna stop here a little bit, because I know that went pretty fast.
17:36:06 And I was coughing with the type. questions you can sort of think of the broken comb, right?
17:36:19 I think that's a good metaphor to what grace is connecting with about the the stages of competence. right?
17:36:26 So each of those different areas as you start building you're going to have that right like maybe you're already starting off with certain skill sets right.
17:36:41 And so that's sort of where your level leveling up right you're, you're building depth in those different areas that you may not have right now.
17:36:55 So. so you know. it's almost like your goal might be to get a full cone right whereas right now you might just be a pi shaped right?
17:37:06 So think of it as not. Everything grows at the same length, and at the same time at or at the same pace. I mean right.
17:37:17 Some of them is going to be a bit more challenging.
17:37:21 Grace, can I do one thing? Yeah. So going.
17:37:27 But could you go back to the the competency slide, please?
17:37:29 So focusing specifically on conscious incompetence you know, realizing that you're not really good at something is perfectly fine.
17:37:40 I say this because for at least when I was just trying to get in to ux I've had people who talked about how like they did a little work in the startup, as the only designer and suddenly they're calling themselves like a ux
17:37:54 lead at the startup. Just keep in mind that, you know.
17:37:57 Fake it till you make it that's definitely a valid philosophy.
17:38:06 For certain cases. However, you can't fake leadership when you're not leading anyone except yourself.
17:38:11 And maybe one other person it's i've i've had people I've seen people actually like I've worked with them.
17:38:23 I know that they didn't lead anyone for squat and they still call themselves a ux lead, and it'll show, because you know, when it's go time and your company.
17:38:34 What a che and It's Okay, just focus on you know finding opportunities, the right opportunities to develop those skills, if you so need.
17:38:42 And oh, God, that's lightning sorry about that it was little lightning right?
17:38:43 That's not yeah, I think the storm's finally hitting though.
17:38:51 Crap and and they're going back to like the different areas that we were like those columns that we were car sorting things into like those are different areas of ux that people can can group things into and those aren't the only
17:39:08 areas, You know Ux is a huge, very multidisciplinary area discipline. And so it's important to know that there are other other relative fields out there that are similar to what I Guess ux people
17:39:24 do and that this is kind of where people don't have expertise in ux because it's only been around for the past 25 years. And so it really we're really just trying to define what this is right
17:39:40 now. So it's not as established as education it's not as established as medicine because they have bodies out there that tell you exactly Yeah, there's that there's a medical bar association and
17:39:53 there's a ethics code as a code. of conduct you know those are out there for those disciplines of those professions that but Ux does not have it right now.
17:40:02 Right. So right now, in terms of what we can do right is like we need to be no be able to identify all for ourselves.
17:40:11 What What do we know What don't we know and Then how can we like level up as we go along?
17:40:15 Right sometimes. like, Oh, what is research learning about research and reading lots of books about it?
17:40:25 These are different ways that we could build our experience and and for my present experience it's always been as I go through different work and different projects by something grow that expect expertise right?
17:40:45 And so there is no like Oh, yeah, once you have that background or like that's done with your learning that's not the case.
17:40:54 There's always different ways that you can improve over time and That's also kind of like how the lattering works in their industry.
17:40:59 Ideally. what happens when you're a junior is that you have an interest in learning your profession in your knowledge right?
17:41:09 You have an idea what this is, and that you're able to work with people and start building your your understanding of what it is to work on a real project. right?
17:41:17 I know, and you know, the the ideal world the the junior person has like from to 4, about to 4 years experience in here, and you can build on that. of course, like what Justin was saying earlier like right now, people can be have one year
17:41:37 or even half a year of experience, and then be considered a lead so that's interesting.
17:41:40 And then ideally, as you move up and then figure out like how you learn certain things ideally that you're as you learn your tools, and you're able to be able to talk more.
17:41:56 About it. You have more fluency in terms of explaining and taking responsibility and explaining those design decisions.
17:42:04 You've you've actually reached a mid-level right and and if you take a look at those job descriptions that you see a lot of those job descriptions are asking or hiring for myths senior but they're calling it
17:42:14 junior right because they want to pay you less right so you have to really consider it like when you're reading those job descriptions.
17:42:28 What are they really looking for experience? Are you expected to bring to the table as when that is?
17:42:34 And you can even find out that many places. some companies are even just copying pasting jet prescriptions from different companies in mishmashing element.
17:42:45 To one. Have you even heard of people who copied and pasted? and I forgot to change the name of the company so like good for them?
17:42:54 But you know it really shows to to tell that people are making this up as they go along right sometimes.
17:43:00 Companies Don't really know what they're really looking for They're saying, Oh, yeah, this company seems to have it, you know, in a good spot.
17:43:05 Let's copy from them and then see what happens so it's really important, like as you're reading something or as you're doing your interviews, you're finding out exactly what you're getting yourself into understand like where does Ux,
17:43:15 fit in the organization. And what what happens What are they expecting from you as a person who's coming in to the he into the onto the team.
17:43:30 And then, senior is like you're able to manage people you're mentoring more. you're more team-oriented You're you're you're being a collision a liaison between the clients and stakeholders on what's going
17:43:46 on you're not doing as much of the work because you're looking.
17:43:48 You're working from a as an oversight your person that someone is is reporting up to. then as a lead.
17:43:57 This is what a lead is supposed to have right you're you're more involved with hiring people.
17:44:05 You're more involved with defining the design and division of the team from a company perspective.
17:44:11 Right you're not actually you're actually not actually working on a project per se.
17:44:18 But you're the person that people report up to all right So you have the strategic vision on what's going on.
17:44:29 So that's kind of the gist of like what the different levels are
17:44:34 But going back to what you were all saying before is like, How do you even know the difference between the different levels?
17:44:40 So I think we go back to here, I guess, to the cart sort like you can really.
17:44:49 See, here are some some ideas in terms of what kind of skills of people could grow these are not the only ones. because if you want to, you can have a whole list of like 500 different skill areas that you might want to work into and that's a lot right this
17:45:09 is just a small little snapshot of like what are the different things that a person can get into in us?
17:45:15 But not all. Do have all of these slides available, because lots of reading. and of course they're in Chicago format. And then lots of references that you can look into as well, so like more more things to read So that you can see
17:45:40 like. How How has this really changed? right because it's not just something that people like made up in the past year?
17:45:50 These are just has been happening for the past 5 years at least 2. I see.
17:45:50 John had a hand up earlier. i'll just add like I think at the senior, and maybe even at the mid-level character that would distinguish it.
17:46:04 Is, you're occasionally working on process improvement not only is your supporting the project work.
17:46:11 You're also thinking about how can we make this better again. it's sort of going to.
17:46:23 I guess at that Senior Bullet Point is team-oriented and process oriented right?
17:46:26 How can we operationalize this? or make this smoother right So that other team members going through this it's there's no hiccups right?
17:46:35 And that's sort of I think if you I don't know if that necessarily translates on a job description coming out.
17:46:44 But that's just something to keep in mind in terms of duties or some responsibilities.
17:46:47 You'll start sort of seeing that you start taking on those type of additional projects.
17:46:58 I think this is also a good transition. or connection to what the comment that Justin added earlier, right about like So just because you see someone who is so it's it's very interesting.
17:47:17 If you when you're in the hiring when you're on a hiring committee, or you're a hiring manager, right you see a lot of resumes and you're like Oh, so for this stint someone was like a
17:47:28 senior ux researcher, you know. so their current position is senior ux researcher.
17:47:39 But then, like 5 years ago, they were director of user research and you're like, oh, interesting!
17:47:42 That seems like a demotion, right? like going from director of user research to senior.
17:47:52 But what you have to recognize is like in startups right?
17:47:55 The hierarchy is a bit flatter. So there, and you might be out.
17:47:57 You also might be taking on a lot more multiple roles too.
17:48:05 So you sort of So there's sort of an inflation too right in that sense of what the position or that title is, and is keeping in mind also a tangent to that right is like, if you're applying to places that are a bit
17:48:18 maybe more structured, maturely right I guess what i'm saying is like big companies, corporate companies right there is going to be a lot more hierarchy involved.
17:48:30 And so equivalent of a senior researcher right or senior designer may be an equivalent to like a user researcher elsewhere. Right?
17:48:41 So really to grace's point about reading the job description to really understand what is actually being asked responsibility wise.
17:48:48 That also means sometimes you you will see those fluctuations on people's resumes or linkedin where they're like they're a researcher here and in somewhere else. They're a lead researcher, and then they fluctuate and you just have to keep that in mind and perspective
17:49:08 twice. No, I don't know if there is a takeaway from that other than that.
17:49:10 Well, the other thing is also sometimes those those labels in terms of like January Senior associate lead.
17:49:21 Those are just adjectives on top of what your mayor mean.
17:49:26 I guess your your craft is right and those are different ways that they companies use to figure out what pay scale that you're at right, and those like you mentioned are not standard across the industry.
17:49:42 So so sometimes I just you can just omit it and just don't even go into like explaining. what level am I?
17:49:51 Am I supposed to be was talking to julia and she does she's been doing a lot of recruiting right for yux jobs, and so there's a ton of jobs out there, But they're all looking for mid to senior level
17:50:02 people right, and then a lot of lot of them or some of them are also saying, who wants to be at like a founding designer of a company right? and that's kind of a scary thing because you're the team of one working
17:50:20 on something, and you don't have that support you don't have that, you know network of people that you can count on to do things.
17:50:28 But you know, that is like one opportunity that people could have.
17:50:33 So yeah, be a foundering designer for this company.
17:50:36 It can redo their site. We do their mobile redo everything, you know.
17:50:40 Set up to all those processes. it's all extra work, but at the same time you get a chance to set up all that structure in that company from the beginning.
17:50:49 Scary a very scary for a junior person who's never worked in a company before.
17:50:58 But yeah, so just keep an eye out for those things.
17:51:01 Where it seemed lucrative. but you don't you it's easy to use a sale than than to succeed it.
17:51:09 Those Aren't really, Anyway, other questions comments yeah I I was just gonna say that i'm glad glad grace that you brought up the point about Junior founding designer or junior founding whatever ux professional at a
17:51:38 startup. Just because I think, yeah, when you're applying for junior roles, you want to make sure that the company has of like proper mentoring or like structure in place folding in place I guess to support someone who is junior.
17:51:54 Because I have heard of yeah people being hired by a startup, because they, the founder of the Startup, knows they need a ux designer, but they have no idea how to support them.
17:52:07 And and and in some cases i've heard of them bringing in like a external like coach like a ux coach, to help kind of be that mentor for them kind of outsourcing the management so I guess that that could
17:52:24 work. if if the coach is, you know very is around for 6 months or so, I guess.
17:52:33 But yeah, I think, yeah, I think looking to make sure as you're interviewing for these jobs definitely ask questions about who and what kind of support they give or will provide? or have they provided in the past to others in a similar position yeah, I have
17:52:56 a of a comment I definitely feel like this conversation speaking to me because I just got a job where i'm basically the only ux designer. There's a ux researcher, a developer and like a project manager that's trying to make our jobs
17:53:12 easier. so and i'm brand new so it's like I feel like I don't know this is relevant to me.
17:53:20 That's all I wanted to say so another thing I might want to add is like you.
17:53:26 Those areas that were out there defined earlier those aren't set in stone.
17:53:35 Right those role titles they shouldn't limit you to knowing to understanding the scope, or like where your product is, or what what you're doing as part of the project.
17:53:48 Right, because everyone brings something else to the table right you're you're sure you're a designer.
17:53:55 But there are designers who do research. They are Ias who do research their Ias who do a cut on strategy.
17:54:03 I mean everything. bleeds right so don't let those role titles restrict you in terms of your responsibilities, because you know, from from different projects, even within a company from project to project.
17:54:16 Those can always change. I remember there was a project I was on where there was a visual designer and I a a kind of strategist and a business analyst. and we all had different ideas on next. Who's writing their user input requirements. Who's writing user stories Who's doing this work. and they really it.
17:54:33 Was very heated just discussion that people had to go out for drinks afterwards.
17:54:40 Too unwind, I would add, Go ahead, Chris, go ahead!
17:54:44 Go ahead. Ok, I would add to it the flip side of that right is, know your lane and swim your lane. don't cross the lane.
17:54:57 If that territory is not meant to be crossed because, as an example, you know, here, in where i'm at like, we have a user research team, and that's what they do. and we have designers, and we respect that even though I may have
17:55:11 a design background. i'm not going to be like Oh, this is how you could do it, and you know they're not going to tell me That's how I can do it right?
17:55:26 But we are trying to move towards we're calling a guided research, which means, hey?
17:55:30 Designers can take up the efforts of doing research as long as there is some guidance on the researchers end right?
17:55:43 But again it's a so what's the takeaway is, Know your lane, but you can be a good partner advocate for your team member, or for what they do. or Be a good thought partner, with Buddy, system.
17:55:57 Right. So there's other ways that you can you know be that multiple hat.
17:55:59 But yet respect the lanes as they are right and that's usually more, I think, in a bigger organization, I think in smart organizations.
17:56:12 It's it doesn't necessarily need to be that restricted right again.
17:56:14 Sort of depends on the maturity of an organization as well. maturity.
17:56:18 How the organization is structured whether you're brought together as a project? whether you work across teams. I think whenever you start a new project, you should have that discussion like what's the it's like What's the racy?
17:56:33 Chart who's, who's responsible who's accountable who's the person who's contributing to which actually doing the work right, who needs to be in forms so like you know defining what those rules and
17:56:44 responsibility that the failure project will help define what those lanes are. and and that would be another good way to help figure out the boundaries of things for that particular project.
17:56:57 I was on it. Clearly wasn't defined well and so try to figure out who owns the content inventory, and who's in charge of doing that?
17:57:08 Was, What are those big discussions? so kitano I just wanted to add, I think sometimes we might need to impose restrictions on ourselves.
17:57:23 So i'm working with a grassroots organization and they had this flyer.
17:57:32 They're running this campaign kind of political and it was the hot mess like it, like I couldn't no one could read that stuff right?
17:57:40 So I did the work of cleaning it up and making it a little more accessible, and they really liked it.
17:57:48 And then they're like Okay, could you do some social media posts for us. And I really had to step back and say, Whoa!
17:57:57 I'm not here to do graphic design work i'm glad you liked it, but we got to get back on track, so I just wanted to mention that like when you're working like independently with people and doing volunteer work just to try to tell them
17:58:12 hey? like i'm not necessarily here to be your graphic designer, you know.
17:58:17 Yeah, Bridget brings up a good point when you're working in that boundary. you're going to be keeping wearing multiple hats and carrying multiple suitcases, right?
17:58:44 But at the same time you know different situations different needs right like, whether you need to wear those hats right in order to support, or if in this case, if you're in a volunteer position like you can only do so much you have
17:58:52 to priorities. Yeah, I just want to add in also like Yes, don't forget to set your boundaries because it is really annoying when you have to do stuff.
17:59:07 They didn't sign up to do but also just don't be afraid to do everything if you need to.
17:59:12 Because sometimes you're not we're not all fortunate enough to have the ideal start, and user experience right like sometimes, you know, we have to the school of Hard knocks is taking quite literally for some of us and you know and if you can last like
17:59:27 you'll come out much stronger in the end yeah I just want to add that in it's it's a tricky game and a very tough balancing act of know what what are you open to learning as well, as what you're able
17:59:42 to do and what you're. absolutely not going to touch that's a good point, and I think maybe i'm speaking from quote more of a veteran senior, So i'm more I have that luxury of like man Nope not gonna do that that's not me that's not my role.
18:00:01 To like. maybe those who are in more transitional or starting where It's like how hungry are you because you need And you want the job, or that career pathing right and you're going to do what you need to do in order to succeed in order to get to that next level right so justin brings up a good point
18:00:16 is don't totally say no right because if you were to hire someone you want, someone who's like Go get her 2 right. You wouldn't want something like Nope. you know, I'm just gonna do what I was only hired to do right
18:00:33 which is, you know, cool too, like I respect the boundary setting there. but you also have to be a team player, right or collaborator, or whatever sort of those different.
18:00:41 Well, you get you get the point. So yeah, yeah, Also, sometimes you just get bored and you want something else to do like it can be of like a fun. little distraction like I had to make graphics for emails.
18:00:55 During my startup time, and I was actually okay with it.
18:01:02 I mean, I hated like the actual email builder but like it was fun to make grat like actually design something again, rather than just pouring over research notes and screaming internally, because nothing worked but that's a different story any
18:01:15 other fun stories to share. I was just gonna say that i've also seen this this idea of kind of stepping outside of the ux roll.
18:01:26 And filling in the gaps somewhere else, happening at the like at the very senior levels.
18:01:35 Where, like a ux designer, steps in as the product manager, because there isn't a product manager is out on leave, or some things happened, and there's a reorganization, and they need someone to play that role
18:01:51 and they sort of get some experience, being kind of like a hybrid between design and product management. I've seen this happen in engineering, too, where engineer, who may have an aptitude for product, management, they may step in in a situation like that
18:02:11 if they're very senior and can handle you know running the project.
18:02:17 So. so. yeah, I think it's interesting and I always personally really admired when someone could do that.
18:02:25 But it is very. It would be very difficult to hold both hats at once.
18:02:28 You in those situations i've definitely seen them step out of the previous role like temperament and into this other role where it's pretty clear. the boundary is is you know, set that they're not doing the previous job while they're covering this other
18:02:47 one. Yeah, I would also say that that is a really good way to like get experience at the same time without leaving occurring jobs, too.
18:02:58 So like, even if you were like as an engineer be able to work on certain things, you know, as and you get that experience.
18:03:08 That's how I see people going around like qa to engineer to product management, and that's how they that stick her a path.
18:03:16 I mean we'll talk about this next month is like how you can take different these different moments and be able to pivot to the role in area that you want to work in 250. so like in a couple of weeks we have
18:03:27 stv ux talk for product management in games and so that particular press that he started as a Qa. person who does qa work in games, and then he's he's able to get into into actually doing work in design and research as a product manager
18:03:49 and he didn't go to boot camp right he didn't go to graduate program.
18:03:53 I'm not even sure if he even finished college you know So I mean, that was just a very I guess, compared to right now is a very different different path that people can take and i've also seen like a lot of people were like
18:04:14 previously. they're like hardcore information architects right and they do research.
18:04:20 And then they start learning about kind of strategy and then Now they're pivoting to like product management like what is the current bath for an information?
18:04:29 Architect, I guess, being on ias is one way right so it's not like you don't set your goal.
18:04:35 Your job title as your destination that's just one of the different places that you can pop along the way.
18:04:48 Bob Iiger started as a weatherman. Of course, John would know.
