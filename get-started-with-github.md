# Get started with GitHub

Every apprentice is setup with a private repo that they share with their mentor. It's where you can practice using... and get feedback. We'll figure out how to use GitHub together.&#x20;

Documentation is an essential part of our work. Whether it's writing for future selves or someone else to take over our work later on, practicing critical writing skills is essential for working together, presentation, collaboration, communication and general making sense altogether.&#x20;

### Why GitHub?

Learning how to use GitHub is good practice to:&#x20;

1. Learning to work in an environment that you might not be familiar with. Learn to identify what you're seeing, feeling, and thinking as you learn to navigate a whole ecosystem and community around open-source
2. Showcasing your work and project contributions. Whether you're collaborating with developers, writing user stories, managing tasks on a kanban board, it's possible on GitHub. At the same time, it's probably good practice since Jira and many other task-based platforms follow similar project structures.&#x20;
