There's a fun Discord bot who we've named "Deya". It's the phonetic name for DIA, 德雅

- 德 (dé), meaning virtue, morality ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_(Chinese))
- 雅 (yǎ), meaning elegance, refined ([source](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%9B%85))

Deya the bot randomly showers people with experience points as they interact on the server.
