# UX Codex



A project around defining a number of various topics (research methods, activities and deliverables) used in the UX field

Resulting in vocabulary building and enforcing learned concepts

Maybe... it'll turn into a deck of trading cards, a board game, bookmarks, a workshop facilitation tool, reference material when introducing terms to future coworkers, clients, and teams!

The Github/Obsidian would be the online library where we could provide more detailed materials for each topic/card (additional resources, our DIA samples)

Could be a long-term project, but eventually we could get these printed out as physical cards and send out to all the apprentices as keepsakes and tools to use in workshops, etc.

## Project Status

Discovery phases -- still determining what information to include, content structure



## How to contribute

This project is in its formative stage. That means, it's prime for anyone to help define the project and layout a roadmap.&#x20;

* \[ ] We currently have a collection of topics (activities, deliverables, and processes) that we might want to cover.

[View GitHub](https://github.com/DIADesignGuild/uxcodex)

* \[ ] We need to develop a project brief, define what and how cards might be used, and determine the scope for a MVP.&#x20;
* \[ ] We need to figure out a content criteria to help assess when a topic is good enough for peer/expert review.
* \[ ] We need to develop a content template so that there is a standard guideline on the content, depending on the medium the information is presented in (card, topic page, etc)
