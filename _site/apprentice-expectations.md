# Apprentice Expectations

As an apprentice, you are in charge of your apprentice plan, keep track of your progress, initiate communication with your mentor, and do the work. The mentor's primary responsibility is to serve as a guide/coach who will help you along the way.

Apprentices are expected to get to know the other apprentices via the DIA Design Guild Discord server and attending SGVUX monthly events.

### Meetings

You and your mentor should meet weekly or biweekly to discuss your progress, get project feedback and direction, and career advice.

This apprenticeship program is at your own pace. You can spend as much time and as little time as you want.

### Apprentice Plan

Your apprentice plan should include the following:

* short-term and long-term apprenticeship goals and success criteria
* how you currently expect to accomplish your goal
* why you are interested
* how a mentor can help you

### Feedback

Feedback is anonymous and always appreciated
