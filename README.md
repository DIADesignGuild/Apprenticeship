# Apprentice Program

Our mission is to help UX-ers grow.

Most companies don't have the time to invest in new practitioners. DIA Design Guild prides itself in providing a safe environment for early career and transitioning professionals to flex their skills and develop their portfolio by pairing them with senior coaches.

Since the beginning, DIA Design promotes apprenticeship and pair design through teaming up a less experienced designer/researcher with a more experienced team advisor. Anyone can apply to be an apprentice at DIA Design. In fact, everyone on the team is assumed to be an apprentice because we believe that everyone is constantly learning and developing their skills.
