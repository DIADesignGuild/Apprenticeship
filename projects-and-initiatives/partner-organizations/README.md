# Partner Organizations

DIA works with a number of nonprofit and community organizations where they require assistance with operations and getting things done. Sometimes the work revolves around event and community design.&#x20;

Not all UX projects are redesign projects. They may require sometime to identify and figure out the problems (discovery, requirement gathering, tech and UX assessment) before actual design and implementation.
